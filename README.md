# FastAPI-GPT

Python code to stream responses with FastAPI and ChatGPT. 

Quickly test this with a CURL post request using `--no-buffer`:

```
!curl -X POST --no-buffer https://your-link.app/response?message=hello
```

Or by adjusting [this Javascript code](https://github.com/DanteNoguez/FlaskGPT/blob/main/templates/index.html) from my FlaskGPT repo.
